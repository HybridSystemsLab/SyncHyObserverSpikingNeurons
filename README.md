# SyncHyObserverMechanicalSysImpacts

This repository contains the Matlab files to simulate an observer for a Zeno bouncing ball along the lines of Section 7.1 in 

*Observer Design for Hybrid Dynamical Systems with Approximately Known Jump Times*, P. Bernard, R. Sanfelice, Accepted in Automatica

It runs on Matlab R2020b and uses the Hybrid Systems Simulation Toolbox available at https://hybrid.soe.ucsc.edu/software, as well as Simulink. 
Instruction : 
1) Make sure Hybrid Systems Simulation Toolbox is on your Matlab path. 
2) Run main.m.
